   * means that the order must have been serviced/visited before the specified time (including the handling time at the address).
   * @Alternative If only an upper boundary for the visit is important the user can also simply choose to define this via the deadline
   * parameter. The difference here is that the handling time at the address is not included in the specified time,
   * i.e. if the vehicle/transport arrives at the location before the deadline then this time constraint is met.
   * For instance consider the visitingTimes from above: if the avgHandlingTime of this order's address is 300 (=5 minutes) then setting

   * visiting end time (or deadline) or after the valid working hours of the vehicle. This will result in penalty points for not meeting
